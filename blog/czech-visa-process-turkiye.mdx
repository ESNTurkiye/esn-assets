In my experience, one of the main challenges of applying for a visa in Türkiye is the length and complexity of the entire process. From the very beginning, students face long waiting times. For instance, while I received my appointment within a week, I know many students who had to wait up to a month just to get an appointment date.

Document preparation is another major difficulty. In the case of the Czech Republic, the embassy accepts documents only if they are translated into Czech — not even English. As a result, I had to spend approximately 3,600 TL on certified translations. This is further complicated by the fact that there is only one authorised translator in Türkiye whose translations are accepted by the embassy.

After submitting all the documents, students may have to wait up to 60 days for a decision. Such long delays can seriously affect Erasmus students, as they risk arriving late to the host country, missing courses, or even losing the Erasmus opportunity altogether.

Overall, the visa process in Türkiye is lengthy and uncertain, often taking at least three months in total. This creates enormous stress for students and makes academic mobility significantly more difficult.
