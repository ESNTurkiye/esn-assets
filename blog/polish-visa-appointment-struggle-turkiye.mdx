Getting a Polish visa in Türkiye was extremely challenging for me, mainly due to the appointment system. Applications are submitted through visa centres, and the most difficult part of the entire process is simply securing an appointment. Very often, appointments do not open at all, and when they do, all available slots are taken within seconds.

I monitored the visa centre’s system for almost two months but was unable to obtain an appointment. In the end, I was forced to use an agency. Later, I realised that many agencies rely on automated systems (bots) to snatch appointments. These agencies charge very high fees — I paid 500 euros, while others paid even more. It was particularly disappointing to see students being financially exploited during such a stressful process.

Due to the limited number of available appointments, some applicants are required to travel to other cities such as Trabzon or Gaziantep. In my case, this would have meant more than 16 hours of travel by car.

Another major difficulty is the visa centre’s website itself. When you check for appointments frequently, your access is often temporarily blocked for several hours or even days — especially during the times when new slots are expected to open. As a result, many applicants feel forced to use multiple accounts. Even when you finally manage to get an appointment and complete all the information, the system sometimes logs you out at the payment stage, which is a very common complaint among students.

It is important to note that these difficulties relate mainly to obtaining an appointment. Once I submitted my application at the consulate with a complete set of documents, the process itself did not present any significant problems.
