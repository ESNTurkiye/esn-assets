# Hello World! 🌍

Welcome to the official blog of the **Barriers of Mobility** project. This is our very first post on our new platform, which we built to give a voice to students facing systemic hurdles in their pursuit of international education.

## Why This Blog?

We created this space to:
* **Share Stories:** Highlight personal experiences and mobility issues.
* **Provide Insights:** Offer data driven perspectives on the barriers Turkish students encounter.
* **Build Community:** Connect students who have gone through similar struggles.

## Technical Note

This site is powered by **Vue.js** and uses **MDX** to ensure that our stories are not only easy to read but also easy to manage and scale. We are committed to keeping this platform accessible and impactful.

Stay tuned for more stories and updates from the ESN Türkiye team!
