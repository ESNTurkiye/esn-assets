Hello everyone. First of all, I wanted to write a short piece to share my visa process with you. I hope you find it useful.

To begin with, I would like to talk a little about what the concept of a visa represents to me. Frankly, it reminds me of an intense, challenging, long-term process made up of many mental thresholds. This is exactly why I chose the title **Overcoming Invisible Barriers**: because I see the visa not as a simple preparation for travel or an event, but as a psychological process — overcoming a phenomenon in itself.

One of the reasons that pushed me to write this text was the hope of helping readers feel, even slightly, that they are not alone, that they are not the only ones in the world going through this process, and of easing, at least a little, the sense of isolation that often accompanies it by sharing my feelings.

I would like to talk a little about myself. Before moving on to my experiences, let me introduce myself: I am a third-year law student, and so far I have faced the visa process three times. With each visa application, I learned very different things and gained very different experiences, so I would like to briefly go through them.

During my first visa application, I was a first-year university student and my purpose was tourism. I applied for a short-term tourist Schengen visa to Greece. At that time, the process went very smoothly because I worked with an office that provided visa consultancy services. However, as I later realised in my subsequent applications, unless it is absolutely necessary, working with visa offices often does not make a significant difference. 

The thing that challenged me the most was the time limitations on documents. This made me realise how important it was to pay attention to the validity periods of each document individually. The waiting period was very exciting, but I did not encounter any problems with my first visa; the process was neither long nor troublesome. When I finally received my first visa, I was genuinely very happy; even though it was short-term, I felt that it would open other doors for me in the future.

For my second visa, I applied for a one-semester study period under the Erasmus Study Mobility programme to Portugal. Everything about this process was completely different. Portugal did not work with any visa centres, which can sometimes work to the applicant’s advantage. Since I was applying for a long-term national visa, the document list was very heavy. At some point, you may genuinely feel like giving up or become very anxious. 

My advice is this: do not lose your motivation. If there are no serious issues, consulates do try to help you. Carefully check the required documents, submit them on time, and continuously review and close any gaps. Motivation letters are also very important — I always submit one as a supplementary document. In this application, I had no missing documents, encountered no issues, and was not asked for any additional paperwork. I managed to complete my second visa process without any problems.

My third visa application made me very nervous because while participating in the Erasmus programme, I had visited Liechtenstein and received a tourist office stamp in my passport. This time, I was applying for a cultural visa to attend a seminar in Croatia. The entire application process and all documents were in Turkish, which surprised me. 

Let me offer a humble piece of advice: do not have anything stamped in your passport other than official stamps. Also, please do not panic if the consulate asks for additional documents. Complete them calmly and thoroughly — in most cases, this is done to help you. 

Throughout all these processes, the anxiety I experience with every visa application was intense, especially because we are not citizens of a European Union member state. Some authorities may request documents that are neither necessary nor required. You are constantly asked questions like: Will you return to your country? What will you do once you return? Being psychologically strong in such moments is very important.

Another major frustration is the lack of available appointments, the high cost, and the long duration of the processes. One of my biggest misconceptions was believing that most people had good intentions and were willing to help each other. What truly matters is choosing your companions in this process wisely.

If there were a few things I wish I had known before applying for a visa, they would be these: First of all, you are not alone. Always seek accurate information and do not believe everything you hear.

After three visa experiences, these are my feelings and lessons. I hope I have written things that may be useful to you. I encourage you to be patient, not to isolate yourself, and to research thoroughly.

Thank you for reading.
