Last year, I was invited to an Erasmus-related meeting which was going to be held in Italy, Ancona. I was so excited to join as a representative of my university. I started searching for a suitable visa appointment which took me almost 2 months to arrange. I had to collect necessary documents, put enough money in my bank account, book the plane tickets, make reservations for my accommodation, write a motivation letter and go to another city to hand in the documents. It was such a tiring process financially and emotionally as a university student but I was happy to have a chance to visit a foreign country for the meeting.

Surprisingly, I had a refusal from the visa office two weeks later. "Since I did not prove enough I was not going to stay there illegally," I was not accepted to the related country. It was such a huge disappointment for me because I collected all of the necessary documents and had 2 invitation letters from the communities that invited me. I strongly believe that it is so unfair to be refused even with the documents and invitations. I was so discouraged about visa applications and lost my hope about my future travels. I hope the visa issues will be fixed soon and we will be able to travel without facing any unfair obstacle.
