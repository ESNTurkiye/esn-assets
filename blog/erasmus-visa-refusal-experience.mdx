---

Last year, I was invited to an Erasmus-related meeting in Ancona, Italy, as a university representative. Arranging a visa appointment alone took almost two months.

The preparation involved collecting documents, securing bank funds, purchasing flight tickets, and writing a motivation letter. This was an exhausting process both financially and emotionally for a student. Two weeks after the application, I received a refusal.

The reason provided was a failure to prove that I would not stay illegally. This was a significant disappointment, especially since I had provided two official invitation letters. This experience led to a loss of hope regarding future travels and highlighted the unfair obstacles students face.
