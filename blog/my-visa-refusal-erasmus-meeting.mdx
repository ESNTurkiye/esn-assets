Last year, I was invited to an Erasmus-related meeting which was going to be held in Italy, Ancona. I was so excited to join as a representative of my university. 

I started searching for a suitable visa appointment, which took me almost 2 months to arrange. I had to collect all the necessary documents, deposit enough money into my bank account, book plane tickets, make reservations for my accommodation, write a motivation letter, and travel to another city to submit the documents. 

It was an incredibly tiring process both financially and emotionally as a university student, but I was happy to have the chance to visit a foreign country for the meeting.

Surprisingly, I received a refusal from the visa office just two weeks later. The reason stated was: “Since I did not prove enough that I was not going to stay there illegally.” I was not accepted by the country. 

It was a huge disappointment for me because I had collected all the necessary documents and had two official invitation letters from the communities that invited me. I strongly believe it is unfair to be refused even when you provide complete documentation and invitations. 

I became very discouraged about visa applications and lost hope for my future travels. I hope these visa issues will be resolved soon so we can travel without facing such unfair obstacles.
