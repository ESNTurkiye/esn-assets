In 2023, I began a journey to move to Italy after being accepted by İtwo Italian universities. While the admission and enrollment procedures were straightforward, the real challenge for Turkish students emerged during the visa process.

Before applying, I secured an apartment through an intermediary for 600 Euros, paying the deposit and two months' rent in advance. I was also awarded an Italian government scholarship of approximately 8000 Euros per year. Despite providing extensive proof of family assets, property deeds, and exceeding the required bank funds, my first application was rejected.

For the second application, I hired an Italian-Turkish lawyer to reinforce the file with legal explanations and translations. However, after months of waiting, I received another rejection citing insufficient financial means. By this time, it was November and the academic year had started. Although I attended courses remotely, the outcome was devastating.

A year and a half of preparation and financial sacrifice resulted in the loss of two academic years. This process led to severe emotional distress and health issues. Ultimately, I felt my right to education was taken away despite following every regulation.
