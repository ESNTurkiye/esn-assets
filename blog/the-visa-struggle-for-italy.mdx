In 2023, I set out on a journey driven by a dream: leaving my university in Turkiye and moving to Italy after being accepted by two Italian universities.

The admission process, entrance exams, and enrollment procedures were surprisingly quick and straightforward. What I didn't know, however, was that for Turkish students, the real challenge often begins after acceptance: the visa process.

Before applying for a student visa, I rented an apartment through an intermediary company for €600. I paid the security deposit, two months rent, and included all official housing documents in my visa application file. Shortly after, I applied for an Italian government scholarship for international students and was accepted. The scholarship amounted to approximately €8000 per year and I added these official documents to my application as well.

In addition, I demonstrated more than the required amount of funds in my bank account, as requested by Italian authorities. I also submitted extensive proof of my family's financial assets, including property deeds and ownership documents. Despite meeting and exceeding every requirement, I unexpectedly received my first visa rejection.

At that point, reapplying was not a choice but a necessity. My university enrollment was complete, my rental contract was signed, my flight tickets were purchased, everything was ready except the visa. I was fully prepared to build my life in Italy.

For my second application, I sought professional help from an Italian-Turkish lawyer who had graduated from a university in Italy. This time, all my documents were reinforced with Italian translations and detailed legal explanations. However, after months of waiting, I received another rejection once again citing "insufficient financial means."

By the time I received the second rejection, it was already November, and my academic year had begun. Since many students were still waiting for visas, the university had opened online education options, and I attended all my courses remotely. Still, the reality was devastating.

Nearly a year and a half of preparation, effort, and financial sacrifice, both mine and my family's, was wasted. Beyond the financial losses, the emotional impact was far more severe. I no longer had a school to attend. I lost two years of my academic life and was forced to return to the very beginning, preparing for everything all over again.

To be honest, the aftermath of this process led me into a deep depression. The extreme stress triggered several health issues, and I struggled both mentally and physically. I was treated unfairly; my right to education was taken away. The work I put in, along with my family's financial support, disappeared despite doing everything "by the book."
