The biggest difficulty I experienced during my visa process was gathering the required documents. There were many documents to prepare, and once my visa appointment was scheduled, I had only a very limited amount of time.

I had to urgently print all the documents, contact the Erasmus coordination office by email for the necessary paperwork, and handle several other related tasks at the same time. 

Additionally, the consulate was located quite far from the city where I study. With the tight deadline, I also had to arrange transportation and purchase tickets quickly, which added even more stress and extra effort to the process.
