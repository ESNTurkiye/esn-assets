My Erasmus journey began with a busy and demanding period of collecting documents for the visa application and constantly monitoring appointment availability. Since there was no consulate or intermediary application centre in the city where I live, I had to travel to another city to submit my documents and attend the in-person appointment. This added extra expenses for transportation and accommodation.

The limited availability of appointment dates, combined with rejections due to minor technical details, forced me to retake biometric photographs, reprint documents, and pay for increased insurance and travel costs. All of this made the process both financially and administratively challenging. 

Despite these difficulties, managing every step — from receiving the acceptance letter to finally getting the visa approval — became one of the most exciting parts of the experience.

After arriving, thanks to the guidance and support of several friends, including ESN members, my city, and the laboratory where I would complete my internship, my daily routine gradually took shape. I participated in orientations, events, and various international social activities such as international dinner nights, which helped me build a diverse international network.

Throughout this experience, I learned how to balance academic responsibilities with social life, adapt to different cultures, improve my foreign language skills, and communicate more effectively. Looking back, all these stages — including the visa process that required relocating to another city and covering additional costs — transformed Erasmus from a simple exchange programme into a comprehensive learning experience. 

It taught me planning, navigating urban transportation, overcoming challenges, and adapting to real-life conditions. I returned as a very different person from when I first left — feeling much more confident and self-assured.
